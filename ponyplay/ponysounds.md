## credit: Rebecca Astor - 2019

### happy

* whinny:    greeting, excited/happy
* nicker:     content, purr, amusement, giggle

### not-happy

* neigh:      need something, confused, unsure
* snort:      tired, unhappy, rather not obey

### warnings

* squeal:     extreme distress, pain

### not for use with trainers

* sigh:       back off, use with other ponies
* scream:  angry, about to fight

The sounds are generally divided into 'happy,' 'not-happy,' and warning sounds.

### The 'happy' sounds

* whinny to greet other ponies, grooms, or trainers, but also generally when you're just excited and happy and loving being a pony.
* Nicker is like a cat's purr, but it can also show amusement, like a human giggling.

### The 'not-happy' sounds

* Neighing is for showing you need something. Food, water, attention, or if you're confused or unsure about a command, or have a question.

* Snorting can signal a few things. You're tired, unhappy, or would rather not carry out a command.

### The 'warning' sounds

* Squealing should only be used if you're extremely distressed or in pain.
* Sighing says 'back off,' and should generally only be used with other ponies.
* Screaming shows that you are angry, and usually only used when two ponies are about to fight. Do not sigh or scream at a trainer or groom if you're not prepared to face the consequences of severe disobedience.

### Special

 Because you are a competition pony and not a pleasure or breeding one, you may, if you think it's appropriate, sigh at a trainer or groom trying to use you for strictly sexual purposes, to warn them that you are not a 'free fuck' like so many ponies, but I suggest neighing and squealing first, using the sigh as a last resort.
