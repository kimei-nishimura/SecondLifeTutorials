# Second Life Pony Play

"Pony Play" in Second Life typically refers to the fetish of humans (or other anthropomorphic characters) taking on the role of a pony, by wearing appropriate tack (such as a bridle, hoof boots and hoof mitts or an armbinder) and behaving like a pony.  Some ponies go much further, using RLV to have their vision, hearing and speech restricted or even removed as they fulfill their fantasies.

This is not to be confused with "bio" horse barns or avatars such as "My Little Pony" characters, which could also use the term "pony play".

Ponies can participate in training and events such as slalom, pulling a cart, playing polo, and other pony-like activities.  Some ponies are also grooms, trainers and owners, spending time taking care of their stable's human pony "herd".  To really get something out of pony play, at least a bit of Role Playing (RP) is needed!

The list of stables below is by no means complete, and is compiled from the author's personal experiences visiting and exploring.  Stables come and go in Second Life, some are public while others are private, and often they are only occupied during the EU day and evening hours.  There are a few stables that are active at other times though.
