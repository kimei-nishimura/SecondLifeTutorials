# Getting started in Second Life - the BDSM primer

## The minimum basics

First, go to <https://secondlife.com> to create your account. Remember that unless you pay for SL Premium, the username you create here cannot be changed.  However, you will be able to change your display name within the game no more than once a week.

Creating an account is free, and there is a lot you can do "in-world" that will not cost anything.

If you want to test things out, go ahead and download the official [**Second Life Viewer**](https://secondlife.com/support/downloads/) (client) after you create your account.  This will be sufficient for a lot, including access to all public lands, but will be limited if you want to use many of the kink-related features, particularly most of the bondage-related features. For that you will need an RLV client.

## Getting a Viewer for BDSM

***RLV*** is the Restrained Love (formerly Restrained Life) Viewer, an alternate client that implements the [**RLV specification**](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Protocol/RestrainedLoveAPI) written in the [**Linden Scripting Language**](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal) (LSL), which can control in-world objects (including your own character).

- The original of these is the Restrained Love Viewer, available from <http://www.erestraints.com/realrestraint/>.
- a popular option, widely used is Firestorm from <https://www.firestormviewer.org/>.
- another option is Kokua, from <https://kokua.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KKA/overview>
All of these viewers are cross-platform, on Windows, OSX and Linux.
