# RLV and OpenCollar

To take full advantage of the ability to do fetish play in Second Life, you need both a ***client (also called a viewer)*** that supports RLV, and in-game you need to have an ***RLV Relay***.  Relays can be built into many objects, including HUDs (objects that attach to your screen) or objects you wear like a collar or a ring.

One of the most common collar options is OpenCollar[^1], which is a free, open-source option available at the ***OpenCollar HQ***[^2] and various partners in-world.  OpenCollar is an object to be worn on your avatar which provides access to an RLV relay and various RLV controls over your character.

an RLV Relay allows other objects within the world to take control over your avatar to either run animations (poses, etc.) or apply clothing, restraints, or restrictions to your avatar.

OpenCollar is just one option, and the scripts used to make the RLV functions of the collar can be put into other devices such as rings, cuffs, earrings, or anything you can wear or attach. There are also HUD-based relays such as ***Satomi's MultiRelay***[^3] or the ***Mars Relay***[^4].
